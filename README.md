# Challenge
Write a python function to index all items in a list. 

## Input
 It should accept two input parameters; the list to search and the value you're searching for. 

## Output
The output should be a list of indices, each represented by a list of numbers.

for e.g. 

* from FindAllList import index_all
* list = [[[2,5,6] , 8 , [8,10]] , [1,2,3]]
* index_all(list,8)
* [[0, 1], [0, 2, 0]]
